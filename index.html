        <p class="sectionTag text-big">What does a business consultant do?</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Generally, there are three stages of a business consultant’s process: discovery, evaluation and implementation. 1. Discovery The first step for any business consultant is the discovery phase, where the goal is to learn about your business. A good business consultant takes the time to learn as much as possible about a business from the owner and employees. 2. Evaluation Once the business consultant has developed an in-depth understanding of your company, they enter the evaluation phase, with the goal to identify where change is needed. This phase includes identifying your company’s strengths and weaknesses as well as current and foreseeable problems. 3. Implementation Once your company and the consultant agree on a plan, the consultant should enter the third phase: the restructuring stage, or implementation of the plan. In this phase, the consultant builds on your assets and eliminates liabilities. </p>

                Business Today is an undergraduate-focused business organization based out of Princeton University. Business Today's team of Princeton undergraduates and board of alumni trustees are singularly focused on expanding the opportunities for communication for today's undergraduate leaders. While you can hire an independent professional, you can also engage the services of a specialized firm for your consulting needs. Big firms like McKinsey & Co. and BCG wouldn’t necessarily fit a small business’s needs and budget, but a local firm might work well.</p>
